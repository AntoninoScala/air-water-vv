Title: Verification and Validation for Air/Water Flow Models
save_as: index.html

This website and repository is to provide complete information on test problems for air/water flow models. These tests are for verification, validation, and benchmarking of computational models. The physical processes being simulated include

* Coupled air and water flow
* Fluid viscosity
* Turbulence
* Surface tension
* Air compressibility (eventually)
* Interaction with porous structures
* Interaction with moving solid objects (vessels, vegetation, structures, etc.)

The scale ranges from very small scales where surface tension effects dominate to the scale of coastal and navigation structures where fluid momentum, density, and pressure dominate.

Select one of the problems below to learn more about the formulation and see results for various models.
