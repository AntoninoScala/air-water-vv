Dambreak flow with tall obstacle - Gomez-Gesteira and Dalrymple (2004)
======================================================================

The problem consists of a 0.4m x 0.3m x 0.61 (dx x dz x dy) column of
water, initially at rest.  Under the action of gravity, the water
column interacts with an obstacle and collapses to a wall.  The
computational domain is a 3D rectangular box with dimensions 1.6m long
x 0.61m x 0.75m high.  The obstacle has dimensions 0.12m x 0.12m, it
is placed on the tank' s bottom and reaches the top of the doamin.
The top of the domain is left open, when the rest of the boundary
patches act as no slio walls.  In the following figure, a sketch of
the dambreak initial conditions is shown.

This case tests the ability of PROTEUS to simulate the free-surface
evolution and forces / pressures on structures. The results of the
simulations can be compared with the data in the following references.
