Random waves generation/absorption
====================================

Description
----------

Random waves typically consist of non-repeatable wave sequences, so each individual wave has different characteristics. In this application, the free surface elevation timeseries that is generated consists of waves with respect to the wave characterstics of the spectrum (Hs,Tp,) defined in the script by the user. Random waves in nature usually follow spectral distributions e.g. JONSWAP and Pierson-Moskowitz spectra and their statistical properties can be predicted. An example of a spectral distribution is shown in the figure below.

Random wave sequences are generated by descritising the spectral distribution into frequency components and composing free-surface and velocity field by superimposing the free-surface elevation and velocity of each individual component. The amplitude of these components is calculated by the spectral distribution. The phasing of each component is either randomly allocated to generate a truly random series or pre-defined in order to generate focused waves. More information on random waves can be found in Goda (2009) and Dean and Dalrymple (1991).


Tests
-----

The python test file named ``test_nonlinearWaves.py`` is made up of three tests:

* The first test checks that the run is completed successfully.
* The second test is to validate the generation of random waves sequence at the exit of the generation zone by comparing it to the theoretical solution. 

One can run this test file typing ``py.test --boxed test_randomWaves.py``.
