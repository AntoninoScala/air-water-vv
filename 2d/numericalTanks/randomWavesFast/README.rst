Random waves generation/absorption
====================================

Description
----------

Random waves in nature typically consist of non-repeatable wave sequences, so each individual wave has different characteristics. In this application, the free surface elevation timeseries that is generated consists of waves with respect to the wave characterstics of the spectrum (Hs,Tp,) defined in the script by the user. Random waves in nature usually follow spectral distributions e.g. JONSWAP and Pierson-Moskowitz spectra and their statistical properties can be predicted. An example of a spectral distribution is shown in the figure below.

Random wave sequences are generated by descritising the spectral distribution into frequency components and composing free-surface and velocity field by superimposing the free-surface elevation and velocity of each individual component. The amplitude of these components is calculated by the spectral distribution. The phasing of each component is either randomly allocated to generate a truly random series or pre-defined in order to generate focused waves. 

The methodology that has been developed and applied herein (Dimakopoulos et al., 2019), uses window processing from a reference timeseries, instead of a direct reconstruction of the spectrum, resulting in reduced computational time, while achieveing a non repeating, irregular wave-timeseries. However, it is important for the user to set a suffieciently large number of frequency components to ensure non repeating patterns (e.g. 2000 frequency components for the genaration of an irregular timeseries of 1000 waves).

Tests
-----

The python test file named ``test_nonlinearWaves.py`` is made up of three tests:

* The first test checks that the run is completed successfully.
* The second test is to validate the generation of random waves sequence at the exit of the generation zone by comparing it to the theoretical solution. 

One can run this test file typing ``py.test --boxed test_randomWaves.py``.
