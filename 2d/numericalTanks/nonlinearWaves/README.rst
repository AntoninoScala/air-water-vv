Non-linear wave propagation
===========================

With increasing wave steepness and decreasing water depth, the shape of the water waves deviates from the sinusoidal profile of the linear wave, as the wave crests become steeper and the wave troughs flatter. In addition, the linear dispersion relation is no longer appropriate for correlating the wave characteristics, as with increasing wave steepness, the influence of the wave height has to be considered in the dispersion relation. 

The kinematics of nonlinear waves can be evaluated using the Fenton Fourier Transform (FFT) theory (Fenton 1988) that uses a simple iterative procedure and covers a broad range of conditions. It is usable to describe both the linear and nonlinear regular wave regimes and provides a solution for nonlinear wave propagating over a collinear current. 

The FFT theory has been used to calculate nonlinear wave properties to be introduced in PROTEUS to generate non-linear waves. In this section, we assess the performance of PROTEUS in generating and absorbing nonlinear waves
