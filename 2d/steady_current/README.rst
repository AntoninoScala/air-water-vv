Steady state current propagation over a flat bottom  benchmark case
===================================================================

The simulation aims to generate a uniform velocity profile in the inlet boundary of the flume and to investigate the development of a fully developed turbulent velocity profile within the length of the flume. 
Uniform velocity profiles simulate deep water currents and are the simplest velocity profiles to investigate wave-current interaction.  Generating turbulent velocity profiles gives confidence in the turbulent models within PROTEUS, important for current interaction with hydraulic structures and floating bodies.

The present problem consists of 2D rectangular numerical flume with height, H, of 1.5 m and a length, L, of 10.0 m, where the mean water depth, h, is equal to 1.0 m. At the left boundary, a uniform horizontal velocity profile is generated with a velocity u\ :sub:`o`\ . At the top boundary atmospheric conditions have been assigned and the bottom boundary acts as a no-slip wall. The right boundary has free outflow conditions. The water phase is initiated with a velocity u\ :sub:`o`\  in order to obtain in a short simulation time steady state conditions. 
A sketch of the domain is given in the following figure.

This test case demonstrates the ability of PROTEUS to simulate the creation of steady state log-profile current within the flume as well as its absorption.
