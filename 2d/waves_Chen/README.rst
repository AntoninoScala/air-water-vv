Submerged breakwater on slope  benchmark case
=============================================

This benchmark simulates Wave propagation near a submerged breakwater
on a slope and the comparisons of the results with experimental data
in the in the nearshore zone are`` revealed and discussed. For the
vertical breakwater, the published data by Jie et al. (2010) are
used. The experiment was conducted in 60 m long, 0.5 m wide and 0.8 m
deep wave flume. A 1/20 slope is placed at one side of the flume. The
size of submerged breakwater is 10 cm crest wide, 1:2 gradient of
front slope, 1:1 gradient of back slope, and 8 cm depth of
submergence.  For more details, see runfiles or references.

Running
