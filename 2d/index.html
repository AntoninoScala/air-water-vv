<h2>Broad crested weir<a class="headerlink" href="#broad-crested-weir" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A broad-crested weir is a standard hydraulic structure used as
discharge measuring device and flow control device in open
channel. This type of weir can be described as a simple solid
rectangular channel obstruction spanned over the whole width of the
channel. Due to the sharp edge of the upper left side corner of the
weir, flow separation occurs at this location.</p>
<p>As the flow propagates mainly in 2 directions, a 2D computational
domain was used for the simulation.  The height of the domain is equal
to <img class="math" src="../images/math/45f481def694095a45674ceb0821825de8176419.png" alt="0.7\mbox{m}"/> and the length might vary from case to case.
The weir has a height of <img class="math" src="../images/math/55903842b2c6f883f869c2fdd82e5a126c6f911e.png" alt="P=0.401\mbox{m}"/> and a width of

free water level is imposed in the left wall boundary condition. The
top of the domain is left open and the right wall of the domain allows
the flow to leave the domain.  In the following figure, a simple
sketch of the structure is presented showing the main parameters.</p>

<p>Proteus is initialised with a free-surface profile that will excite
the first asymmetric sloshing mode. The free-surface slope is small,
therefore, we can consider that the flow evolution will obey to the
linear sloshing theory. The output of Proteus can be compared with the
analytical solution found in Ibrahim (2005) including only a symmetric
mode. The computational domain is a 2D rectangular box with dimensions

<h2>Crump weir<a class="headerlink" href="#crump-weir" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A crump weir is a typical hydraulic structure mainly used as a
measurement device in open-channels as well as for flow control. It is
a triangular channel obstruction consisting of a 1:2 upstream and a
1:5 downstream slope.The slope upstream is designed to avoid material
sedimentation while the downstream side is designed to stabilize the
flow. The weir spans the width of the channel and obstructs the
natural flow of the water.The following two flow conditions are
tested:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Modular flow conditions, where the flow regime is not affected by
the downstream conditions. In this condition there is a direct
relation between the flow rate and the upstream head. The modular
flow condition is verified when the ratio between the downstream and
the upstream total head is less or equal to 0.75.</li>
<li>Non-modular flow conditions, where the flow regime is affected by
the downstream conditions. This happens when the weir operates in
submerged conditions.  The flow rate in this case is related to the
total head upstream and downstream of the weir and therefore both
head measurements are required.</li>
</ul>
<p>The computational domain is a 2D rectangular box with height equal to
2.1m the length might vary from case to case.The weir has a height of

velocity distribution from bottom to free water level is imposed in
the left wall boundary condition.  The top of the domain is left
open. The right wall of the domain allows the flow to leave the domain
for the case of the modular flow, when for the case of the non-modular
flow an outflow velocity and downstream water level are imposed on the
right boundary.</p>

<p>For extracting column heights and width a separate pvpython scripts

pvpython needs to be installed. This is a special python shipped with

<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$PROTEUS/proteusModule/scripts/gatherArchives.py -s #NP -f dambreak_p</pre>
</div>
<p>This will generate a file dambreak_p_all#NP.xmf which can be used for extracting column heights and width by running

<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$PROTEUS_MPRANS/scripts/dambreakExtractHeightAndWidth.py -f dambreak_p_all#NP.xmf</pre>

do this:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The script allows skipping time steps and only extracts variable deemed important,
thereby greatly reducing the file size and hence the time to copy data form remote location.</li>
<li>In the resulting solution files every time step has a distinct solution file,
which allows visualization of results while the simulation is still running.</li>
<li>The scripts also outputs VTK files which allows visualization with VisIt (and others).</li>
</ol>
<p>Repackaging of the solution can be done by running the following commands in the directory containing the xmf/h5 solution files.</p>

<h2>Nonlinear waves propagation over a flat bottom<a class="headerlink" href="#nonlinear-waves-propagation-over-a-flat-bottom" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Plane regular nonlinear waves are mild and high steepness waves that
propagate in a single direction, in uniform wave fronts.  The wave
profile deviates from the sinusoidal shape, and it typically exhibits
high and sharp wave crests and low and flat wave troughs.  We cannot
always accurately calculate the wave celerity from the linear
dispersion theory, especially for highly nonlinear waves.
Fenton (1988) proposes a method for calculating the nonlinear wave
properties and profile, which we have adopted for the generation of
nonlinear waves within Proteus.</p>
<p>Given the wave period, the wavelength will be a function of the water
depth. So it is the wave period, water depth and the wave height that
contribute to the linearity or nonlinearity of the wave. Their
interrelation is summarised in the following figure (Lé Méhauté 1976).</p>
<div class="figure align-center">

<p>where, the vertical axis corresponds to the no dimensional wave height
and the horizontal to the no dimensional water depth. The term gT<sup>2</sup>is proportional to the wavelength in deep water and the dot

present problem consists of 2D rectangular numerical flume with height
of 1.5 m and a length of 40.6 m, where the mean water depth is equal

generated with a height of 0.109 m and a period of 2.95 s using
Fenton&#8217;s method (Fenton, 1988). In the top boundary atmospheric

<h2>Wave/current interaction<a class="headerlink" href="#wave-current-interaction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The presence of a current in the wave field causes the waves to

is the change the wavelength due to a Doppler shift. If the wave and
current travel in the same direction (following current), then the
wavelength is increased over the one that waves would possess in still
water. If waves and current travel in opposite direction (opposing
current) then the wavelength is decreased. Wave current interaction
with the waves also affects the wave height due to wave energy
conservation and the wave height decreases for following currents and
increases for opposing currents. Given the wave period, modified
height, depth and current velocity, the Fenton Fourier Transform
theory can be used to calculate wavelength, particle velocities and
pressure and these variables can be imposed as a boundary conditions
in a numerical wave flume.</p>

<p>The present benchmark case aims to simulate 2 different cases of

60.0 m. The mean water depth is equal to 1.0 m. The flux parameters of
the modified waves due to a uniform current are imposed at the left
