The Delft Hydraulics measurements have a linear scale n_L=2 compared
to the Beji measurements on which the computations are based. To
compare the measurements withy the computations the surface levations
should be divided by 2 and the time should be divided by sqrt(2).

We consider the measuring conditions A, B and C, defined as follows
for an undisturbed depth of .40 m:
A:    T = 2.02  s and H = 2   cm
B:    T = 2.525 s and H = 2.9 cm
C:    T = 1.01  s and H = 4.1 cm .

For measuring condition A the two files #bea01.asc and #bea02.asc are
given where the time window 10 to 70 s has been given with interval
dt = 0.05 s. This is in unscaled variables (i.e., belonging to a
depth of 0.80 m). Notice that "be" comes from "Beji", "a" comes from
condition A and "01" and "02" denotes the fact that the measurements
had to be repeated with another position of the free surface
elevation measuring probes (termed GHM in Dutch).

In scaled dimensions (i.e., belonging to the undisturbed depth 0.40
m) the columns in the files mean the following: in the first column
the time is given and in next six columns the free surface elevations
for the six probes is given.

bea01  1     2      3       4       5       6       7
     time   2 m    5.7 m   10.5 m  13.5 m  15.7 m  19 m

bea02  1     2      3       4       5       6       7
     time  4 m     5.7 m   12.5 m  14.5 m  17.3 m  21 m

The bottom geometry is in scaled dimensions (i.e., undisturbed depth
0.40 m) as follows. Here is given (x,z) while z=0 is in the still
water level.
(0,-.40), (6,-0.40), (12,-0.10), (14,-0.10), 17,-0.40), and further
constant depth, z=-0.40 m. This geometry is also given in the plot
bq-geom.hpg .

In unscaled dimensions (undisturbed depth -.80 m), a slightly
different configuration has been used:
(0,-0.86), (5.22,-0.86), (6.42,-0.80), (11.01,-0.80), (23.04,-0.20), 
(27.04,-0.10), (33.07,-0.80), (40.61,-0.80), (41.82,-0.86), futher
constant depth, z = -0.86 m. A active wave absorber with mean
position was placed at 46.04 m.  

The locations of the wave probes in the unscaled dimensions were:
3.04 m, 7.04 m, 9.44 m, 20.04 m, 24.04 m, 26.04 m, 28.04 m, 30.44 m,
33.64 m, 37.04 m, 41.04 m.
